## Project: Leaflet Homework

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of data analysis and dynamic/interactive exploratory concepts using [US Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Data](https://www.usgs.gov/) via a public [API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). Data was retrieved from the API in GeoJSON format and engineered to generate an interactive and responsive map web page using [the Leaflet library for JS](https://leafletjs.com/). This project was completed using JavaScript, D3.js, the Leaflet library, HTML and CSS.

## Notes:
- Earthquake map marker sizes are proportionate to earthquake magnitude, and marker colors are relative to recorded depth of the earthquake in kilometers. Markers are clickable to reveal tooltips with precise location, time, depth and magnitude statistics. Refer to the map legend for additional details on the depth color scale.

- The (`logic.js`) file is located in the static/js folder.
